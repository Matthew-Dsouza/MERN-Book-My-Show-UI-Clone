Plan -> How are we building it?
• Layouts
• Routes
• Pages
• Components

HOC - Higher Order Components
    • Components accept some props & states & return JSX elements.
    • HOC returns a component instead of JSX element.

Layout First Approach: 
• Layout first approach is, you'll only build a layout(skeleton) of a website.
• Advantage of using this approach is you'll not render the default layout(header/footer) while changing between pages, only the content will be updated.

Single Page Applications: 
• Using JS, React will render & update the contents of the file without reloading the whole page.
• It's updating html contents for the same file. It's only mounting new components and unmounting old components.
• Your components will be rendered inside the index.html file

`exact` - Renders only the function component that is called without rendering it's previous component.

<></> are known as React fragments.
• React strict rule is that every code should be enclosed inside a parent element. We can use use empty angular brackets(fragments) instead of div.

... is known ad Spread Operator. 
• It was introducedin ES6 to copy the properties of an object into a new object while adding new properties to new object.
• const newNegan = { ...oldNegan, goodGuy: true }

• In React, if you are building a component, first letter should be capital.
